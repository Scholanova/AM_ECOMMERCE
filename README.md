# SN_SPRING_ECOMMERCE
Practicing unit test on a Spring e-commerce project

## Getting started
Ensure that you can build and run the project as is. Choose the IDE and dependency manager you are familiar with. I recommend using IntelliJ and Gradle if you want some help.
* Clone the project in a new directory

## What is expected ?
The project is divided into several parts. Some of them are fully working, some miss to be fixed or completed. You have to complete each part in order to have a fully working, tested project.
## How your work will be examinated ?
Your final score will be based on
- Your ability to fix the project
- Your ability to write code corresponding to tests in a TDD fashion
- Your ability to write unit tests
- Your ability to write clear and elegant code

What you have to do :
#### Product:
Noting particular to do. This is a working example. It will help you to use correct architecture and configuration for other parts.
